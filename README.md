# Mealz App üç≤

A sample Android application that displays meal categories from [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). This project serves as a practical demonstration of modern Android development architecture.

The primary goal was to implement a **Clean Architecture** pattern and practice **Dependency Injection** using **Koin**.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Concepts Demonstrated

* **Clean Architecture:** The codebase is separated into three distinct layers (Presentation, Domain, Data) to ensure a clean separation of concerns, making the app scalable and maintainable.
* **Dependency Injection:** Used **Koin** to manage and provide dependencies throughout the app, which helps in decoupling components and improving testability.
* **MVVM Architecture:** Followed the Model-View-ViewModel pattern in the presentation layer for a clear separation of UI and business logic.
* **Jetpack Compose:** The entire UI is built using modern declarative UI with Jetpack Compose.
* **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow:** Handled all asynchronous operations for networking and data handling in a non-blocking way.
* **Retrofit:** Used for making network requests to the REST API.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, separating the project into three main modules/layers:<br>
+--------------------------------------------------+<br>
|               Presentation Layer                 |<br>
|       (UI - Jetpack Compose, ViewModel)          |<br>
+--------------------------------------------------+<br>
|<br>
+--------------------------------------------------+<br>
|                  Domain Layer                    |<br>
|    (Use Cases, Models, Repository Interface)     |<br>
+--------------------------------------------------+<br>
|<br>
+--------------------------------------------------+<br>
|                   Data Layer                     |<br>
| (Repository Implementation, API Service, DTOs)   |<br>
+--------------------------------------------------+<br>
